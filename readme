# Frick Duplicate Tabs

A Chrome extension that automatically detects and closes duplicate tabs to keep your browser organized and improve performance.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Monitors tabs in real-time for duplicates
- **Smart Closing**: Keeps the most recently accessed tab when duplicates are found
- **Window-Aware**: Only closes duplicates within the same browser window
- **Startup Cleanup**: Scans and removes existing duplicates when the extension starts
- **Memory Efficient**: Built-in cleanup system prevents memory leaks

## How It Works

The extension continuously monitors your tabs and automatically closes duplicates based on:
- URL matching (ignoring fragments and www subdomain)
- Last accessed time
- Tab focus and window activity

When duplicates are detected, it intelligently keeps the most relevant tab and closes the others, then focuses the remaining tab.

## Installation

1. Load the extension in Chrome's Developer Mode
2. The extension will automatically start monitoring and closing duplicate tabs
3. No configuration needed - it works silently in the background

## Technical Details

- Uses Chrome Extensions API v3
- Lightweight background script with debounced operations
- Handles edge cases like loading tabs, chrome:// URLs, and browser navigation
- Includes periodic cleanup to prevent memory buildup
