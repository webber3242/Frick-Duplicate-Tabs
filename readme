Frick Duplicate Tabs: Automatically close them & Activate Remaining Tab Closer
A Chrome extension that automatically detects and closes duplicate tabs to keep your browser organized and improve performance.
Features

Automatic Detection: Monitors tabs in real-time for duplicates
Smart Closing: Keeps the most recently accessed tab when duplicates are found
Window-Aware: Only closes duplicates within the same browser window
Startup Cleanup: Scans and removes existing duplicates when the extension starts
Memory Efficient: Built-in cleanup system prevents memory leaks

How It Works
The extension continuously monitors your tabs and automatically closes duplicates based on:

URL matching (ignoring fragments and www subdomain)
Last accessed time
Tab focus and window activity

When duplicates are detected, it intelligently keeps the most relevant tab and closes the others, then focuses the remaining tab.
#Installation
Load the extension in Chrome's Developer Mode
The extension will automatically start monitoring and closing duplicate tabs
No configuration needed - it works silently in the background

 
-> Uses Chrome Extensions API v3
